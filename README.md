## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

The code should run without any additional libraries beyond those included in the Anaconda distribution of Python. It is compatible with all Python 3.* versions.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interested in using the Seattle Airbnb dataset to better understand:

1. Which factors influence the rental price (in Seattle)?
2. How do prices change over the months?
3. What is the most popular neighbourhood in Seattle based on bookings?




## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

A single notebook is available here to showcase work related to the above questions. It explores the data relevant to the questions outlined in the motivation. Markdown cells are included to guide readers through the thought process behind each step.

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available here.

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements<a name="licensing"></a>

Thanks to Airbnb for the data.  The licensing information and additional details can be found at the Kaggle link provided [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/airbnb/seattle/data).  Otherwise, feel free to use the code as you wish!
